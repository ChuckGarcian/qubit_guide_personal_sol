Phase can be thought as the pattern of the wave. Consider the bellow

The two wavers I_1 and I_2 each have a different phase which causes them two interfer when add I + I. Such a difference of phase is the relative phase. This suggests when two waves have the same phase and no relative difference in their phase then it has no effect. ;
