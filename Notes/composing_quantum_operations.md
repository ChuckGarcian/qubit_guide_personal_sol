# Composing Quantum Operations

## Remark


**Claim:** What is computation and what are the following types of computation 

  1. Deterministic computation
  2. Non-determistic computation

**Proof:**

Computation is a physical process that evolves a prescribed initial configuration called input into some final configuration called output.

1. The initial configuration evolves through a single sequence of states to reach the final output configuration.

2. The initial configuration can evolve through more then one path to reach the final output configuration.

**Claim:** Given an initial state and final state how is probability computed?

**Proof:**

The probability amplitude of a particular final state being reached is the sum amplitudes of all mutually exclusive paths which connect initial state and final state.

**Claim:** 

1. The transition amplitudes associated with a single time step in a computational process can be represented as a matrix.

2. The total probability amplitude associated with an initial input evolving into a particular output can be computed via matrix multiplication
